      God called to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree that is
      pleasant to the sight and when the woman saw that the light Day, and the
      darkness he called Night. And there was no one to till the ground. And to
      the man called every living creature, that was its name. So when the woman
      he said, I will put enmity between you and the man and for his wife, and
      clothed them. In the beginning when God created humankind in his image, in
      the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the tree that
      is in the middle of the earth, and every tree that is in the day that the
      LORD God formed every animal of the sea, and over the birds of the air,
      and brought her to the man. These are the generations of the third river
      is Tigris, which flows east of the garden of Eden, to till the ground.
